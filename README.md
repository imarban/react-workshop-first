Workshop to learn react

# Getting started

The following two exercises will help you crete your first ReactJS components, you probably will be disappointed with the output you will get for all the work you will be required to do, so you can either walk away or be a little bit patient to get to the point where things pay back.

- [Exercise-01](exercise-01.md)
- [Exercise-02](exercise-02.md)
- [Exercise-03](exercise-03.md)

# JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML â€” an XML-like syntax for constructing markup within React components.

In [Exercise-04](exercise-04.md) you will see the advantages of using **JSX** instead of calling direcly the react's DOM api.
