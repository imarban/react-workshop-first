Workshop to learn react

# Getting started

The following two exercises will help you crete your first ReactJS components, you probably will be disappointed with the output you will get for all the work you will be required to do, so you can either walk away or be a little bit patient to get to the point where things pay back.

- [Exercise-01](exercise-01.md)
- [Exercise-02](exercise-02.md)
- [Exercise-03](exercise-03.md)

# JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript XML â€” an XML-like syntax for constructing markup within React components.

In [Exercise-04](exercise-04.md) you will see the advantages of using **JSX** instead of calling direcly the react's DOM api.

# JSX offline transform

You probably are thinking that it will cost a lot of time to the browser to `JSXTransform` all our scripts, and that the `html` file will no longer be maintainable as we continue adding more features. We can transform/process the **JSX** server side using the `react-tools`.

In the [Excercise-05](exercise-05.md) you will learn how to deal with this problem and jump to the next level.

# The requirements

- [Node.js & npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)

# The setup

- Create a directory for the project and then run `npm init`, follow your instincts to answer the wizard's questions.

# Install the [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) framework
In the command line run `npm install react --save-dev` this will download the framework and update your `package.json` dependencies.
